=====================================

This branch only contains the source code documentation of both the

[SystemVerilog](https://mbgh.github.io/aes128-hdl/sv/index.html) implementation
of the AES-128 design as well as the documentation of the [verification
environment](https://mbgh.github.io/aes128-hdl/tb/index.html) based on UVM.
